# Computer infrastructure assessment

## 

This workflow automates the collection and visualisation of recent stock market data of a group of 5 tech companies: 
- Facebook (META)
- Apple (AAPL)
- Amazon (AMZN)
- Netflix (NFLX)
- Google (GOOG)

As the project goes on the focus is on creating a repeatable, schedulable, script-driven process that can be executed consistently.
